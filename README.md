# NLP_project

This repo contains Notebooks for three different classifiers build for the TU Delft NLP project on 'Building sentimental classifiers and robustness testing'
- [Embedding model](Embedding_layer_model.ipynb) contains an NGram CNN feedforward model with a Fast Gradient Sign Method adversarial attacker
- [Bi-RNN](RNN_soft_attention_NLP_Project.ipynb) contains a Bi-directional LSTM with a soft-attention layer and a HotFlip adversarial attacker
- [Self-Attention](NLP_self_attention_hot_flip.ipynb) contains a Self-Attention model and a HotFlip adversarial attacker
